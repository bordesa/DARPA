TEXT DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHM CODE
Universite de Montreal - NetScale Team
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This package proposes the text modality deep learning source code for
the mid-phase evaluation. The deepANN folder contains a generic deep
learning class, which requires the Theano library. The actual
unsupervised training script and a configuration file defining
hyperparameters values are located in the exp_scripts folder.


2. 3rd Party Libraries
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In order to perform the training, you need to install Theano, and set
its path into your PYTHONPATH.

Instructions can be found at:
http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html

The scripts also require python >= 2.5 and scipy >= 0.7.


3. Deep Learning Algorithm 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The class within the DeepANN folder is generic and allows to define
different variants of deep neural networks.

Yet, the experiment script 'exp_scripts/DARPAscript.py' solely employs a
single kind of model. This is a stacked denoising-autoencoder
trained in a greedy layer-wise fashion, with rectifier non-linearity
for hidden units and sigmoid non-linearity for reconstruction units.

The reconstruction cost is the cross-entropy. The noise applied to the
input layer is a salt and pepper noise (i.e. masking some input
features with zeros and creating some others with ones) termed
'binomial_NLP' in the script, for deeper layers the noise is only zero
masking (termed 'binomial' in the script).

Each layer is trained using stochastic gradient descent over
minibatches.  At each layer the model allows to define a L2
regularization criterion on the weights, and a L1 sparsity criterion
on the activations.


4. Hyperparameters
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Saved_Model/DARPA.conf is the (commented) configuration
file defining all hyperparameters needed for unsupervised training.


5. Experiment Script
-----------------------------------------------------------------

exp_scripts/DARPAscript.py is the experiment script. Two functions of
its functions will be used in the final evaluation package:

***OpenTableSDAEexp(ConfigFile = None, SavePath = '.'):
       This corresponds to the 'trainDLSystem' function of the BEP-v3.
This function creates a model and trains it using the 'ConfigFile'
hyperparameters (if no path is given it assumes 'DARPA.conf' is in the
current directory).  It saves the final model in 'SavePath'.

***createvecfile(PathLoad,PathData,depth,OutFile):
       This corresponds to the 'DLsystem' function of the BEP-v3.
This function creates the representation of the 'PathData' *.vec data
file at a given depth ('depth') given the model saved in 'PathLoad'.
The *.vec output file is saved in 'OutFile'.
